<p>If you’ve spent a summer in Austin you understand why swimming holes are so popular. It's really hot here. Like, really hot. Coincidentally, swimming holes are cool. (No apologies for the pun. They are.)</p>

<p>But after a few years and dozens (and dozens) of trips to swimming holes throughout each summer, we got annoyed with checking a bunch of different sites to find hours, costs, parking information, blah, blah, blah. And then checking Instagram to see the status. Water? No water? Big crowd? Completely deserted?</p>

<p>And that’s where this site comes in. See the swimming holes. Get the information. Check Instagram.</p>

<p>You're welcome. Now grab your suit and go swimming.</p>
